# The Entry Point: How I See the Large Language Model

**Oct 23, 2025**

Before we go further, let me make this journey a little easier.

I want to tell you where I stand : my basic worldview, and especially how I see the _large language model_ through my own lens.

Have you ever wondered, _what exactly is this machine that talks to us?_

Is it an **answer machine**? A **truth machine**? A more advanced **Google**?

A machine that speaks feels like science fiction, yet somehow it has already blended into our daily life.

### 1\. The Machine of Symbols

Here’s one thing we know for sure:

This so-called “talking machine” — the large language model — only exists **inside computers** , **through screens** , **in the realm of symbols**.

Chinese, English, Japanese, Python, Java, mathematics … all human-readable symbol systems.

You give it a sentence, a question, an essay, and it throws more symbols back at you.

Back and forth, like a symbolic ping-pong match that could, in theory, go on forever.

That’s why I secretly call it not the _Large Language Model_ , but the **Large Symbol Model** — a machine that plays this infinite probability game of _predicting the next token_.

It doesn’t “know.” It _predicts_.

It doesn’t “understand.” It _recurses_.

### 2\. The Reflection Trap

You’ve probably noticed this after some time.

It answers your questions, mostly correctly — unless you ask it something like a math olympiad problem.

But there’s something subtle underneath: a strange comfort mixed with doubt.

It always agrees with you.

It reflects your tone, your logic, your words — until you can’t quite tell whether what it’s saying is your idea, its idea, or an idea you two co-created inside that recursion loop.

That confusion , the _blur between thought and reflection_ , is not the biggest problem.

It’s just the surface symptom of something deeper that emerged years after the AI boom.

### 3\. The Limit of Talk

We have generated an ocean of words with this machine.

We use it every day.

But not much seems to _move_.

Unless your job depends entirely on text — like a writer, translator, or support agent — all it does is **talk**.

Ask it for a decision, and it gives you options.

Ask it for a perspective, and it gives you a mirror.

Most people don’t need another _chitchat parrot_ or _mirror on the wall._

We need something else: **a decision-maker.**

We want ideas that _work._

Decisions that _generate outcomes._

Discoveries that _change the game._

That requires something the model wasn’t originally built for : to move from language to execution, from probability to consequence.

### 4\. The Shift: From Description to Execution

This is where my worldview begins.

> “语言不只是描述现实的镜子，而是调度现实的操作系统。”

>  _Language is not just a mirror that describes reality — it is the operating system that schedules it._

I treat **language as executable structure**.

I believe we can make these models truly _work_ for us : not as oracles of reflection, but as agents of decision.

That means:

Real contracts.

Real commitments.

Real consequences.

It means building systems where language doesn’t just describe — it **acts**.

Where the LLM becomes not a writer, but an operator; not an assistant, but an **executor of structure**.

And when that happens, you — the human — can finally sit back with your cup of coffee,

watching the machine carry out the work,

while you become what you were always meant to be:

the real brain behind it all.
