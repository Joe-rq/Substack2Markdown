“Build an App with Just One Claude Skill and One .json File — No Code, Just Structure.” —Susan STEM

[Read full story](https://www.entropycontroltheory.com/p/lesson-5-build-a-smart-shopping-app)

In my coding universe, **your rules are never set by the model or by me, the SKILL provider**.

They are set entirely by **you** , the top-level user — the sovereign of your own system.

A simple `SKILL.md + .json` pair can already form a _flexible, self-learning organism_.

No hidden database. No closed source. Just a living file that grows with you.

## 🧾 From Shopping Trip to Living Structure

Remember the _smart shopping SKILL_ I shared?

I finally went to Costco — now it’s time to **teach my system**.

All I do is:

  1. Take a photo of my receipt.

  2. Upload it.

  3. Say: _“Input my receipt.”_

  4. (And upload my existing `.json` ledger from last time.)




Claude reads it through OCR, extracts the list, and updates my data.

 **That’s it.** Nothing else to code or click.

The system learns directly from the world.

## 🧠 Setting Personal Rules — The Real Paradigm Shift

Here’s the principle:

> In an AI-native world, code should follow cognition, not the other way around.

So any rule, threshold, or preference lives in your `.json` file — not in my code,

not in the model’s hidden weights.

Example:

I like to buy _any kind of bread_ — Hawaiian, Danish, ham rolls — it’s all “bread” to me.

So I simply tell the system:

> “Count all bakery items as bread.”

One line, one sentence, saved forever in my ledger.

From now on, it classifies any bread automatically.

That’s _structure DNA_ at work — language becoming an executable rule .

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gNb2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b0d3ef-50a0-477a-ab17-c442c7b097e4_730x691.heic)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gNb2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b0d3ef-50a0-477a-ab17-c442c7b097e4_730x691.heic)

And I need to add an limit. Say I want to control the calories of my bread stock. So I simply say: as long as my bread stock is exceed 2000 cal, then I am fine on stock. I don’t know each of my groceries’ calories, I just need an estimate, let the model to go figure it out.

Great! That’s it! I have input my groceries, and I successfully set some new rules that are completely personal. And buy a few sentences. my file remembers. Let’s see if it works. Open a new window and let’s see.

It worked! In a new chat window, because the single source of truth （唯一真相源）is in the .json file.

## 💾 Where It Lives

Every preference you declare is stored as natural-language metadata inside your `.json` ledger .

Unless you overwrite it, it persists — and applies to every future run.

Your file remembers.

Your structure evolves.

## ⚙️ The New Paradigm of Software Programming

This lesson reveals a deeper principle of **AI-Native Architecture** :

Software is no longer something _you use_ —

it becomes something that **learns you**.

## 🌱 Minimal Proof of Life

With just **one SKILL** and **one**`.json` **file** ,

you already have a **self-learning app** — detailed, personal, and alive.

It’s not about automation; it’s about **self-evolution, flexibility, and file ownership** .

This is the beginning of the _Structure-Based Personal System_ :

language → structure → scheduler → feedback —

a complete cognitive organism running on your own data.
