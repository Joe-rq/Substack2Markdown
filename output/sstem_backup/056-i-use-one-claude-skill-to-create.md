**I use one Claude Skill to build a living relationship system** and there’s nothing my old contact manager was doing that this doesn’t do—only **way** more

 **Create rich contact profiles** that track collaboration history 

**Generate meetings and follow-ups** in natural language, linking them to people 

**Sense relational dynamics** through interaction patterns 

**Detect scheduling conflicts** across your network 

And you can ask questions your normal contact app would never understand—like “Who haven’t I talked to in a while?” or “Show me everyone I’m collaborating with on the Chicago project”

Or, “what is weird on my schedule this month?”
