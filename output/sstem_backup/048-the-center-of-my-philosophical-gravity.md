# The center of my philosophical gravity is — and has always been — human.

I’ve stopped chasing after scientific theses for a while.

I’ve stopped trying deploying all the open-source models.

Because I realized one thing:

> Even if every model stopped advancing from today on,
> 
> we’d still be fine.

Because the center was never the model.

It’s already good enough.

The real center of this paradigm shift has always been **human** —

the thinkers.

 **You.**

Yes, **YOU!**

### Intention is the engine

意图才是改变世界的引擎

Intention is the engine that changes the world.

Without intention, all energy disperses randomly.

Language becomes noise.

Intelligence becomes mere computation.

意图让这些随机的波动产生“目的性的不对称”。

Intention turns random fluctuations into purposeful asymmetry.

That asymmetry — that directed imbalance —

is the starting point of entropy reduction,

the spark that gives birth to creation itself.

> Intention is the true hammer of civilization.

So here, you won’t find an endless stacking of papers and data.

Because I understand the relationship between **the tool and the pilot**.

My logic is different:

> I am not growing a model —
> 
> I am growing **the thinker**.

### The Human–AI Interface

In this new interface between human and AI:

  * The **thinker** is the pilot.

  * The **AI** is the copilot.




思考者需要一整套与AI共生的思考模式与技能。

Thinkers need a complete set of cognitive patterns and skills

to coexist and co-create with AI.

That’s what we’re here to explore —

not waiting for AGI to descend,

not hoping for a button that solves everything.

Instead, we must train:

  * our **language** ,

  * our **metacognition** ,

  * our **thinking structure** ,

  * our **expression** ,

  * our **collaboration** ,

  * and our **intuition**.




This is a **thinker-centric theory** —

a framework for human-AI **symbiosis and co-evolution**

in the age of intelligence.

 **Note:**

 **Intention turns random fluctuations into purposeful asymmetry.**

In the beginning, the universe was a field of perfect symmetry—high entropy, evenly distributed energy, random motion, and no preference or purpose. Everything moved without distinction, a sea of equal probabilities. Then, intention emerged: a local act of bias within chaos, a small region that began to move toward something rather than everything. A plant turning toward sunlight, an animal fleeing danger, a thinker forming a thought—all are expressions of this _purposeful asymmetry_. Intention breaks the neutrality of randomness and gives direction to energy, transforming diffusion into flow, chaos into structure, entropy into life. In the language of entropy control, **intention is the directional bias introduced into an entropic field—the force that turns randomness into creation, and gives meaning to motion.**
